## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how the AI Processing Layer handles data and privacy concerns when you use our software library.

**Repository**: https://github.com/mupoese/ai-processing-layer/

## Data Handling Principles

### What We Collect

The AI Processing Layer is a software library that:

- **Does NOT collect personal data** from end users
- **Does NOT transmit data** to external servers by default
- **Operates locally** within your application environment
- **Processes data** only as directed by your application code

### Data Processing

When you use AI Processing Layer in your applications:

1. **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs within your local environment
2. **Memory Management**: Temporary data may be cached in memory for optimization
3. **No External Transmission**: The library does not send data to external services
4. **User Control**: You have complete control over what data is processed

### Caching and Memory

The AI Processing Layer includes caching mechanisms:

- **Temporary Storage**: Data may be temporarily stored in memory for performance
- **LRU Cache**: Uses Least Recently Used cache eviction policies
- **Memory Cleanup**: Cached data is automatically cleaned up according to your configuration
- **No Persistent Storage**: Data is not persisted to disk unless explicitly configured

## Developer Responsibilities

As a developer using AI Processing Layer, you are responsible for:

### Data Protection

1. **User Consent**: Obtain appropriate consent for data processing in your application
2. **Data Minimization**: Only process data necessary for your application's functionality
3. **Security Measures**: Implement appropriate security measures for sensitive data
4. **Access Controls**: Control access to AI agent communications

### Compliance

1. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure your use complies with applicable privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
2. **User Rights**: Implement user rights (access, deletion, portability) as required
3. **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies
4. **Documentation**: Document your data processing practices

## AI-Specific Privacy Considerations

### Agent Communications

- **Inter-Agent Messages**: Messages between AI agents are processed locally
- **Token Optimization**: Message compression maintains data integrity
- **Memory Context**: Agent memory is stored locally and under your control

### Data Processing

- **No Model Training**: The library does not train models on your data
- **No Data Collection**: No usage analytics or telemetry is collected by default
- **Algorithmic Transparency**: Processing logic is open source and auditable

## Third-Party Integrations

If you integrate AI Processing Layer with external services:

1. **Review Third-Party Policies**: Understand the privacy policies of any external services
2. **Data Transmission**: Be aware of what data you're sending to external services
3. **User Notification**: Inform users about external service integrations
4. **Consent Management**: Obtain appropriate consent for external data sharing

## Security and Privacy Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest
2. **Validate Inputs**: Always validate and sanitize input data
3. **Monitor Access**: Log and monitor access to sensitive operations
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep the library updated for security patches

### For End Users

1. **Understand Applications**: Know how applications using this library process your data
2. **Review Permissions**: Review what permissions applications request
3. **Data Rights**: Exercise your rights under applicable privacy laws
4. **Report Issues**: Report privacy concerns to application developers

## Data Subject Rights

While AI Processing Layer itself doesn't collect personal data, if your application does:

### Rights Under GDPR/CCPA

- **Right to Access**: Users can request access to their data
- **Right to Rectification**: Users can request correction of their data
- **Right to Erasure**: Users can request deletion of their data
- **Right to Portability**: Users can request their data in a portable format
- **Right to Object**: Users can object to certain processing activities

## Children's Privacy

AI Processing Layer is not designed for use by children under 13. If you're building applications for children:

1. **COPPA Compliance**: Ensure compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
2. **Parental Consent**: Obtain verifiable parental consent when required
3. **Data Minimization**: Minimize data collection from children
4. **Enhanced Security**: Implement enhanced security measures

## International Data Transfers

If your application processes data across borders:

1. **Legal Mechanisms**: Use appropriate legal mechanisms for international transfers
2. **Adequacy Decisions**: Rely on adequacy decisions where available
3. **Standard Contractual Clauses**: Use SCCs or other approved transfer mechanisms
4. **Data Localization**: Consider data localization requirements

## Updates to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect:

- Changes in the AI Processing Layer functionality
- Updates to applicable privacy laws
- Best practice recommendations

**Last Updated**: 2024
