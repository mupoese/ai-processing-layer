## Reporting a Vulnerability

The AI Processing Layer project takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by email to:
- **Email**: [Create an issue in the repository with the label "security" for public discussions, or contact the maintainers directly]
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mupoese/ai-processing-layer/

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish with this vulnerability?
4. **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected?
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: We will provide regular status updates throughout the investigation
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Security Best Practices

When using AI Processing Layer:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate input data before processing
2. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for agent communications
3. **Encryption**: Use encrypted connections when transmitting sensitive data
4. **Access Control**: Implement appropriate access controls for AI agents
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor system logs for suspicious activity
6. **Updates**: Keep the library updated to the latest version
7. **Memory Management**: Be aware of memory usage patterns in AI operations

### Known Security Considerations

- **AI Agent Communication**: Ensure trusted agent verification before processing messages
- **Memory Caching**: Sensitive data in cache should be properly secured
- **Token Optimization**: Compressed data should maintain security properties
- **Binary Protocol**: A114 protocol data should be validated for integrity

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
2. We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
3. We will coordinate the timing of public disclosure
4. We will provide security advisories for significant vulnerabilities
